# USB_eload
This is built off of my previous Electronic Load project, a now deleted repository. I wasn't happy with the state and the direction the project was heading so I am creating a new project.
This electronic load will be controlled via USB 2.0 and will include constant resistance, constant power, constant current, and constant voltage modes.
